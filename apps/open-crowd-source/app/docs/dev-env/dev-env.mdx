# Setting Up Development Environment

This guide will help you setup required tools and libraries to start customizing the project according to your needs. By the end of this guide, you will have a working development environment and you will be able to run the project on your local machine.

Note: This guide is written for Linux users. Guides for other operating systems will be added soon.

<Steps>

### Installing Volta

Volta is a tool manager for JavaScript. It allows you to install and manage different versions of Node.js and other JavaScript tools. You can install Volta by running the following command in your terminal:

### Cloning the Project

You can clone the project by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlock
  lang="bash"
  code="git clone git@github.com:anisole-labs/open-crowd-source.git && cd open-crowd-source"
/>

### Installing PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. We suggest you to install PostgreSQL using Docker. You can install Docker by following the instructions on the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After installing Docker, you also need to install `docker-compose` by following the instructions on the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

After installing Docker and `docker-compose`, you can create a new PostgreSQL container by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlock
  lang="bash"
  code="docker-compose up -d"
/>

### Installing Project Dependencies

After installing all the required tools, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlock
  lang="bash"
  code="pnpm install"
/>
