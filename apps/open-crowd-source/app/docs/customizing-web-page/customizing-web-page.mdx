# Customizing the Web Page

This is the simplest part of the project. All the customization is done in one single file, `apps/open-crowd-source/config/site.ts`. You can edit this file to change the content of the boilerplate. 

Note: Detailed documentation on each section of the `site.ts` file will be added soon.
