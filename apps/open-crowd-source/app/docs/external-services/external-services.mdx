# External Services

It's inefficient to write all the code for your application yourself. Instead, one should use external services to handle things like sending emails, storing data, and processing payments. This is a good thing, because it allows you to focus on the core functionality of your application.

We'll be using a few external services in this course. Here are the ones we'll be using:
